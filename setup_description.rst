`Pystache <https://github.com/defunkt/pystache>`_ is a Python
implementation of `Mustache <http://mustache.github.com/>`_. Mustache is
a framework-agnostic, logic-free templating system inspired by
`ctemplate <http://code.google.com/p/google-ctemplate/>`_ and
`et <http://www.ivan.fomichev.name/2008/05/erlang-template-engine-prototype.html>`_.
Like ctemplate, Mustache "emphasizes separating logic from presentation:
it is impossible to embed application logic in this template language."

The `mustache(5) <http://mustache.github.com/mustache.5.html>`_ man page
provides a good introduction to Mustache's syntax. For a more complete
(and more current) description of Mustache's behavior, see the official
`Mustache spec <https://github.com/mustache/spec>`_.

Pystache is `semantically versioned <http://semver.org>`_ and can be
found on `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pystache>`_. This version of
Pystache passes all tests in `version
1.1.2 <https://github.com/mustache/spec/tree/v1.1.2>`_ of the spec.

Requirements
------------

Pystache is tested with--

-  Python 2.4 (requires simplejson `version
   2.0.9 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/2.0.9>`_ or earlier)
-  Python 2.5 (requires
   `simplejson <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/>`_)
-  Python 2.6
-  Python 2.7
-  Python 3.1
-  Python 3.2

JSON support is needed only for the command-line interface and to run
the spec tests. We require simplejson for earlier versions of Python
since Python's `json <http://docs.python.org/library/json.html>`_ module
was added in Python 2.6.

For Python 2.4 we require an earlier version of simplejson since
simplejson stopped officially supporting Python 2.4 in simplejson
version 2.1.0. Earlier versions of simplejson can be installed manually,
as follows:

::

    pip install 'simplejson<2.1.0'

Install It
----------

::

    pip install pystache
    pystache-test

To install and test from source (e.g. from GitHub), see the Develop
section.

Use It
------

::

    >>> import pystache
    >>> print pystache.render('Hi {{person}}!', {'person': 'Mom'})
    Hi Mom!

You can also create dedicated view classes to hold your view logic.

Here's your view class (in .../examples/readme.py):

::

    class SayHello(object):
        def to(self):
            return "Pizza"

Instantiating like so:

::

    >>> from pystache.tests.examples.readme import SayHello
    >>> hello = SayHello()

Then your template, say\_hello.mustache (by default in the same
directory as your class definition):

::

    Hello, {{to}}!

Pull it together:

::

    >>> renderer = pystache.Renderer()
    >>> print renderer.render(hello)
    Hello, Pizza!

For greater control over rendering (e.g. to specify a custom template
directory), use the ``Renderer`` class like above. One can pass
attributes to the Renderer class constructor or set them on a Renderer
instance. To customize template loading on a per-view basis, subclass
``TemplateSpec``. See the docstrings of the
`Renderer <https://github.com/defunkt/pystache/blob/master/pystache/renderer.py>`_
class and
`TemplateSpec <https://github.com/defunkt/pystache/blob/master/pystache/template_spec.py>`_
class for more information.

You can also pre-parse a template:

::

    >>> parsed = pystache.parse(u"Hey {{#who}}{{.}}!{{/who}}")
    >>> print parsed
    [u'Hey ', _SectionNode(key=u'who', index_begin=12, index_end=18, parsed=[_EscapeNode(key=u'.'), u'!'])]

And then:

::

    >>> print renderer.render(parsed, {'who': 'Pops'})
    Hey Pops!
    >>> print renderer.render(parsed, {'who': 'you'})
    Hey you!

Python 3
--------

Pystache has supported Python 3 since version 0.5.1. Pystache behaves
slightly differently between Python 2 and 3, as follows:

-  In Python 2, the default html-escape function ``cgi.escape()`` does
   not escape single quotes; whereas in Python 3, the default escape
   function ``html.escape()`` does escape single quotes.
-  In both Python 2 and 3, the string and file encodings default to
   ``sys.getdefaultencoding()``. However, this function can return
   different values under Python 2 and 3, even when run from the same
   system. Check your own system for the behavior on your system, or do
   not rely on the defaults by passing in the encodings explicitly (e.g.
   to the ``Renderer`` class).

Unicode
-------

This section describes how Pystache handles unicode, strings, and
encodings.

Internally, Pystache uses `only unicode
strings <http://docs.python.org/howto/unicode.html#tips-for-writing-unicode-aware-programs>`_
(``str`` in Python 3 and ``unicode`` in Python 2). For input, Pystache
accepts both unicode strings and byte strings (``bytes`` in Python 3 and
``str`` in Python 2). For output, Pystache's template rendering methods
return only unicode.

Pystache's ``Renderer`` class supports a number of attributes to control
how Pystache converts byte strings to unicode on input. These include
the ``file_encoding``, ``string_encoding``, and ``decode_errors``
attributes.

The ``file_encoding`` attribute is the encoding the renderer uses to
convert to unicode any files read from the file system. Similarly,
``string_encoding`` is the encoding the renderer uses to convert any
other byte strings encountered during the rendering process into unicode
(e.g. context values that are encoded byte strings).

The ``decode_errors`` attribute is what the renderer passes as the
``errors`` argument to Python's built-in unicode-decoding function
(``str()`` in Python 3 and ``unicode()`` in Python 2). The valid values
for this argument are ``strict``, ``ignore``, and ``replace``.

Each of these attributes can be set via the ``Renderer`` class's
constructor using a keyword argument of the same name. See the Renderer
class's docstrings for further details. In addition, the
``file_encoding`` attribute can be controlled on a per-view basis by
subclassing the ``TemplateSpec`` class. When not specified explicitly,
these attributes default to values set in Pystache's ``defaults``
module.

Develop
-------

To test from a source distribution (without installing)--

::

    python test_pystache.py

To test Pystache with multiple versions of Python (with a single
command!), you can use `tox <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox>`_:

::

    pip install tox
    tox

If you do not have all Python versions listed in ``tox.ini``--

::

    tox -e py26,py32  # for example

The source distribution tests also include doctests and tests from the
Mustache spec. To include tests from the Mustache spec in your test
runs:

::

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

The test harness parses the spec's (more human-readable) yaml files if
`PyYAML <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML>`_ is present. Otherwise, it
parses the json files. To install PyYAML--

::

    pip install pyyaml

To run a subset of the tests, you can use
`nose <http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/0.11.1/testing.html>`_:

::

    pip install nose
    nosetests --tests pystache/tests/test_context.py:GetValueTests.test_dictionary__key_present

**Running Pystache from source with Python 3.** Pystache is written in
Python 2 and must be converted with
`2to3 <http://docs.python.org/library/2to3.html>`_ prior to running
under Python 3. The installation process (and tox) do this conversion
automatically.

To ``import pystache`` from a source distribution while using Python 3,
be sure that you are importing from a directory containing a converted
version (e.g. from your site-packages directory after manually
installing) and not from the original source directory. Otherwise, you
will get a syntax error. You can help ensure this by not running the
Python IDE from the project directory when importing Pystache.

Mailing List
------------

There is a `mailing list <http://librelist.com/browser/pystache/>`_.
Note that there is a bit of a delay between posting a message and seeing
it appear in the mailing list archive.

Authors
-------

::

    >>> context = { 'author': 'Chris Wanstrath', 'maintainer': 'Chris Jerdonek' }
    >>> print pystache.render("Author: {{author}}\nMaintainer: {{maintainer}}", context)
    Author: Chris Wanstrath
    Maintainer: Chris Jerdonek


History
=======

0.5.3 (TBD)
-----------

-  Added option of raising errors on missing tags/partials:
   ``Renderer(missing_tags='strict')`` (issue #110).
-  Added a ``parse()`` function that yields a printable, pre-compiled
   parse tree.
-  Added support for rendering pre-compiled templates.
-  Bugfix: exceptions raised from a property are no longer swallowed
   when getting a key from a context stack (issue #110).
-  Bugfix: lambda section values can now return non-ascii, non-unicode
   strings (issue #118).
-  More robust handling of byte strings in Python 3.

0.5.2 (2012-05-03)
------------------

-  Added support for dot notation and version 1.1.2 of the spec (issue
   #99). [rbp]
-  Missing partials now render as empty string per latest version of
   spec (issue #115).
-  Bugfix: falsey values now coerced to strings using str().
-  Bugfix: lambda return values for sections no longer pushed onto
   context stack (issue #113).
-  Bugfix: lists of lambdas for sections were not rendered (issue #114).

0.5.1 (2012-04-24)
------------------

-  Added support for Python 3.1 and 3.2.
-  Added tox support to test multiple Python versions.
-  Added test script entry point: pystache-test.
-  Added \_\_version\_\_ package attribute.
-  Test harness now supports both YAML and JSON forms of Mustache spec.
-  Test harness no longer requires nose.

0.5.0 (2012-04-03)
------------------

This version represents a major rewrite and refactoring of the code base
that also adds features and fixes many bugs. All functionality and
nearly all unit tests have been preserved. However, some backwards
incompatible changes to the API have been made.

Below is a selection of some of the changes (not exhaustive).

Highlights:

-  Pystache now passes all tests in version 1.0.3 of the `Mustache
   spec <https://github.com/mustache/spec>`_. [pvande]
-  Removed View class: it is no longer necessary to subclass from View
   or from any other class to create a view.
-  Replaced Template with Renderer class: template rendering behavior
   can be modified via the Renderer constructor or by setting attributes
   on a Renderer instance.
-  Added TemplateSpec class: template rendering can be specified on a
   per-view basis by subclassing from TemplateSpec.
-  Introduced separation of concerns and removed circular dependencies
   (e.g. between Template and View classes, cf. `issue
   #13 <https://github.com/defunkt/pystache/issues/13>`_).
-  Unicode now used consistently throughout the rendering process.
-  Expanded test coverage: nosetests now runs doctests and ~105 test
   cases from the Mustache spec (increasing the number of tests from 56
   to ~315).
-  Added a rudimentary benchmarking script to gauge performance while
   refactoring.
-  Extensive documentation added (e.g. docstrings).

Other changes:

-  Added a command-line interface. [vrde]
-  The main rendering class now accepts a custom partial loader (e.g. a
   dictionary) and a custom escape function.
-  Non-ascii characters in str strings are now supported while
   rendering.
-  Added string encoding, file encoding, and errors options for decoding
   to unicode.
-  Removed the output encoding option.
-  Removed the use of markupsafe.

Bug fixes:

-  Context values no longer processed as template strings.
   [jakearchibald]
-  Whitespace surrounding sections is no longer altered, per the spec.
   [heliodor]
-  Zeroes now render correctly when using PyPy. [alex]
-  Multline comments now permitted. [fczuardi]
-  Extensionless template files are now supported.
-  Passing ``**kwargs`` to ``Template()`` no longer modifies the
   context.
-  Passing ``**kwargs`` to ``Template()`` with no context no longer
   raises an exception.
