        Build a Context instance from a sequence of context-like items.

        This factory-style method is more general than the Context class's
        constructor in that, unlike the constructor, the argument list
        can itself contain Context instances.

        Here is an example illustrating various aspects of this method:

        >>> obj1 = {'animal': 'cat', 'vegetable': 'carrot', 'mineral': 'copper'}
        >>> obj2 = Context({'vegetable': 'spinach', 'mineral': 'silver'})

            arguments will be skipped.  Items in the *context list are
            added to the stack in order so that later items in the argument
            list take precedence over earlier items.  This behavior is the
            same as the constructor's.

          **kwargs: additional key-value data to add to the context stack.
            As these arguments appear after all items in the *context list,
            in the case of key conflicts these values take precedence over
            all items in the *context list.  This behavior is the same as

        Query the stack for the given key, and return the resulting value.

        This method queries items in the stack in order from last-added
        objects to first (last in, first out).  The value returned is
        the value of the key in the first item that contains the key.
        If the key is not found in any item in the stack, then the default
        value is returned.  The default value defaults to None.

        When speaking about returning values from a context, the Mustache
        spec distinguishes between two types of context stack elements:
        hashes and objects.

        In accordance with the spec, this method queries items in the
        stack for a key in the following way.  For the purposes of querying,
        each item is classified into one of the following three mutually
        exclusive categories: a hash, an object, or neither:

        (1) Hash: if the item's type is a subclass of dict, then the item
            is considered a hash (in the terminology of the spec), and
            the key's value is the dictionary value of the key.  If the
            dictionary doesn't contain the key, the key is not found.

        (2) Object: if the item isn't a hash and isn't an instance of a
            built-in type, then the item is considered an object (again
            using the language of the spec).  In this case, the method
            looks for an attribute with the same name as the key.  If an
            attribute with that name exists, the value of the attribute is
            returned.  If the attribute is callable, however (i.e. if the
            attribute is a method), then the attribute is called with no
            arguments and instead that value returned.  If there is no
            attribute with the same name as the key, then the key is
            considered not found.

        (3) Neither: if the item is neither a hash nor an object, then
            the key is considered not found.

        *Caution*:

          Callables are handled differently depending on whether they are
          dictionary values, as in (1) above, or attributes, as in (2).
          The former are returned as-is, while the latter are first
          called and that value returned.

          Here is an example to illustrate:

          >>> def greet():
          ...     return "Hi Bob!"
          >>>
          >>> class Greeter(object):
          ...     greet = None
          >>>
          >>> dct = {'greet': greet}
          >>> obj = Greeter()
          >>> obj.greet = greet
          >>>
          >>> dct['greet'] is obj.greet
          True
          >>> Context(dct).get('greet')  #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
          <function greet at 0x...>
          >>> Context(obj).get('greet')
          'Hi Bob!'
